The province is dominated by the Murghab River in the north and the Hari-Rud River in the south. Badghis remains extremely underdeveloped, especially outside the provincial capital of Qalay-i-Naw. The province is inhabited by Tajiks who are thought to make up 62 per cent of the population with Pashtuns making up approximately 28 percent.

Currently, the security situation has deteriorated in the northern districts of Ghormach and Murghab, both of which are heavily populated by Pashtuns and sympathetic to the local Taliban. The strategic “ring-road” highway that connects Kabul to Kandahar and Herat also has an uncompleted northern leg, a portion of which cuts through Badghis. The roadway in Badghis is currently unpaved and all efforts to begin work on it has faced delays due to security issues. Until 2008, there was no permanent Afghan Army presence in the province, and most provincial police units were based in the capital with only 40-50 security personnel stationed in each of the remote districts.

Dr. Jamaluddin Ishaq, an ethnic Tajik, but reported to be a member of a Pashtun national party. He was appointed to be the Governor of Badghis in September 2015 by President Ashraf Ghani. This is believed to be his first position in the Afghan government. Upon taking office, Ishaq laid out his top priorities: improving security, procuring electricity from Turkmenistan, and clean drinking water in the provincial capital of Qala-i-Naw.13

Baghlan maintains an ethnically diverse population which includes Tajiks, Pashtuns, Uzbeks, Hazara and Tartars.

Agriculture remains a main source of labor for Baghlan residents particularly in northern parts of the province where grapes, pistachio nuts, pomegranates and sugar beets are grown. Since the 1940s, Baghlan has served as a big producer of Afghan sugar with a large refining facility located near Pul-i-Khumri. Decades of war, instability and drought severely damaged Baghlan’s economic capabilities.

Recent efforts by NATO and the international community have rehabilitated a large sugar factory near Pul-i-Khumri with some sugar refining operations beginning in 2006. A second sugar factory was finished the following November, but its inauguration was marred after a suicide-bomber detonated himself among the opening ceremony, killing at least 68 people; mostly young children tasked with singing in a choir to the visiting Members of Parliament who were visiting the facility. Five visiting MP’s, including, former Commerce Minister Sayed Mustafa Kazemi, died in the attack.

Baghlan has suffered from ineffective governance since 2001 with nine different governors attempting to bring stability and security to the province. The current governor, Munshi Abdul Majeed, replaced Haji Mohammad Akbar Barakzai, who was appointed in January 2009. A recent series of suicide bombings, factional fighting, and criminal activity has continued to plague Baghlan, including its provincial capital, Pul-i-Khumri.

Balkh has a tradition of high educational standards and has a comparatively high literacy, also for women, and Balkh is home to several universities including Balkh University, the second largest university in Afghanistan.

Balkh is ethnically diverse, including substantial Tajik, Hazara, Pashtuns, Arab, Uzbek, Turkomen, and Sunni Hazara (Kawshi) communities.  The current governor, Ustad Atta Noor Mohammad, is a Tajik with a concentrated political power-base in Balkh and served as the provincial head since 2004.

Its capital is the city of Kandahar, Afghanistan's second largest city, which is located on the Arghandab River. The greater region surrounding the province is called Loy Kandahar. The Emir of Afghanistan sends orders to Kabul from Kandahar making it the de facto capital of Afghanistan, although the main government body operates in Kabul. All meetings with the Emir take place in Kandahar, meetings excluding the Emir are in Kabul.  Excavations of prehistoric sites by archaeologists such as Louis Dupree and others suggest that the region around Kandahar is one of the oldest human settlements known so far.

...Early peasant farming villages came into existence in Afghanistan ca. 5000 B.C., or 7000 years ago. Deh Morasi Ghundai, the first prehistoric site to be excavated in Afghanistan, lies 27 km (17 mi.) southwest of Kandahar (Dupree, 1951).

The area was called Arachosia and was a frequent target for conquest because of its strategic location in Asia, which connects Southern, Central and Southwest Asia. It was part of the Medes territory before falling to the Achaemenids. In 330 BC it was invaded by Alexander the Great and became part of the Seleucid Empire following his death. Later it came under the influence of the Indian emperor Ashoka, who erected a pillar there with a bilingual inscription in Greek and Aramaic. The territory was ruled by the Zunbils before Arabs of the Umayyad Caliphate arrived in the 7th century. ");

The population of the province is around 1,136,677,[2] which is mostly a tribal society; it is one of Afghanistan's most ethnically diverse provinces with many different ethnicities in large numbers living there.[3][4][5] The city of Kunduz serves as the capital of the province. It borders the provinces of Takhar, Baghlan, Samangan and Balkh, as well as the Khatlon Region of Tajikistan. The Kunduz Airport is located next to the provincial capital. the 18th and 19th centuries it was the capital of a rather large eponymous, sometimes independent, sometimes autonomous Uzbek-Tajik khanate that in the 1820s encompassed land from Balkh to the Pamir Mountains. It was part of The Great Game between the British and Russians. This khanate was finally destroyed by Afghanistan in 1859. In the early 20th century, between one-hundred and two-hundred thousand Tajiks and Uzbeks fled the conquest of their homeland by Russian Red Army and settled in northern Afghanistan.[5]

In the early 20th century, under the governance of Sher Khan Nasher, Kunduz became one of the wealthiest Afghan provinces. This was mainly due to Nasher's founding of the Spinzar Cotton Company, which continues to exist in post-war Afghanistan.

Kunduz is the most important agricultural province which produces wheat, rice, millet, and other products and obtained the nickname of "the hive of the country."

Kunduz is the centre for the northeast provinces and was captured by the Taliban in 1997. It was the last major city held by the Taliban before its fall to US-backed Afghan Northern Alliance forces on 26 November 2001.

During the summer of 2015, the Taliban advanced and attacked the city, which resulted in a battle for control of the city against Afghan forces. Tens of thousands of inhabitants were displaced internally by the fighting.[6][7][8] On 28 September 2015 the Taliban flag was again raised in the city center and the Taliban managed to capture the city prison and free many prisoners.[9][10] The Afghan Armed Forces counter-attacked and managed to re-capture the city in 15 days. The Taliban announced that, after achieving their objectives, they have withdrawn from the city's center. Zabiullah Mujahid, a Taliban spokesperson, said that their main object in leaving the city is to avoid civilian casualties from air raids.[11] In April 2018 the Afghan Air Force conducted an airstrike that killed and injured dozens of civilians at a religious school in Kunduz.[12] On 31 August 2019, the Taliban forces launched another attack on the city, setting off a major battle with local security forces.
