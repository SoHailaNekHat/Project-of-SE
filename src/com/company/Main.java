Mazar-i-Sharif, located in Balkh, is Afghanistan’s fourth largest city and by far the most important urban center of the northern region.  Given the relative security and political stability in Balkh, development and construction projects like irrigation rehabilitation has occurred over the past five years.  A substantial amount of almond and apricot orchards have been planted and maintained since the irrigation overhaul began.

Balkh has a tradition of high educational standards and has a comparatively high literacy, also for women, and Balkh is home to several universities including Balkh University, the second largest university in Afghanistan.

Balkh is ethnically diverse, including substantial Tajik, Hazara, Pashtuns, Arab, Uzbek, Turkomen, and Sunni Hazara (Kawshi) communities.  The current governor, Ustad Atta Noor Mohammad, is a Tajik with a concentrated political power-base in Balkh and served as the provincial head since 2004. Although largely secure, recent insurgent incursions into Balkh are increasing, and Taliban affiliated insurgent fronts are gaining momentum in the northeast (Baghlan-Kunduz corridor) and the northwest (Badghis-Faryab corridor).
